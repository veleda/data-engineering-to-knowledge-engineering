## Demo of From Data Engineering to Knowledge Engineering
Based on my two tutorials on Substack. 
- Part I: [From Data Engineering to Knowledge Engineering in the blink of an eye](https://veronahe.substack.com/p/from-data-engineering-to-knowledge)
- Part II: [Data Engineering Ontologies](https://veronahe.substack.com/p/data-engineering-ontologies)

**The tech**
- Data Engineering: [Polars](https://pola.rs) : open-source and ultra fast data processing through data frames
- Knowledge Engineering: [maplib](https://pypi.org/project/maplib/) : open-source and ultra fast RDF knowledge graph construction

## How to run
- Download, fork or clone the repo
- `pip install polars`
- `pip install maplib`
- `python knowledge_engineering.py` : should print a dataframe with Planets and their moon count
